            This assignment's main goal was to establish the platform to which subsequent
            assignments would be based off of. I chose to implement the layout you see now because
            I had found an example on W3. I saw it and thought, I could make something pretty cool with this. I believe
            it was <i>very</i> informative to learn HTML and CSS via a simple text editor, as
            opposed to a more competent IDE. Personally I'm very used to Visual Studios 2013 and 2015, two very
            powerful IDE's, and I found that the simplicity of not using these technologies has helped me better
            grasp the fundamental topics listed below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Major aspects of the assignment were getting familiar with using Ubuntu as a web hosting
            platform, implementing changes to style via CSS files, using common html tags, and
            and following the directions of sites like W3. I am used to a technology called, Razor which embedds
            C# directly into the HTML allowing there two be logic in the rendering of the page. In this assignment
            I found it very strange to have to hard code all of this information. If you look at the source code, I'm sure you'd understand
            what I mean if your technologically inclined. Overall, this project was very fun, took me ~8 hours or so of experimenting
            and reading, and I mostly completed the final work on 1/15/2016.

            This assignment was difficult because I had never used javascriptoutside of a dedicated environment like Visual Studios.
            I found that it was difficult to debug, until I realized the utility of Edge's debugging tools. I'm sure this is
            applicable to all dev tools in web explorers but I saw that when I had written my javascript code I tended to say
            .text as opposed to .value and that messed with me a lot. Also assigning a function to a click event was pretty difficult as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I played alot with the structure of the website after the last assignment and the majority of my time was spent on that.
            I plan on expanding this assignment to be a full fledge automatic mailing using php. However I will soon implement the
            opening of the link similar to project 1 and passing the information gathered from the form via the url.
            Overall, this project was very insightful, took me ~8 hours or so towards restructuring the sight and about the same to create the javascript. I completed the final work on 2/7/2016.

            The goal of this assignment was to further develop my javascript skills and inadvertently refreshed my skills in statistics! This assignment also really heavily used modularity to reduce the amount of code
            necessary to actually create. An interesting problem that occured was whether or not I should put code inline with the html, or inside of a javascript file. After I thought about it I came to the conclusion that if it pertained to collecting data inside my
            form that only pertained to the html it resided in it should live there. If some other html page can use it then it should be in a file.
