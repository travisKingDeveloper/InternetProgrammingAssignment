    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Reflecting on my child hood, I grew up in an environment that was perfect for a future programmer.
        Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined I would have gravitated to programming so much. To be
        completely honest, I hated computers.
        I had always had one that was unbearably slow and I would always get frustrated and walk away from it.I went to
        college as an Electrical Engineer,
        but soon realized I had entered for the wrong reason's and I was trying to convince myself I liked the program,
        instead of actually enjoying what I was doing.
        I had looked at many alternatives including English, Communications, and Math, but I could never find what it is
        that I saw myself doing in twenty years.
        Through my time with the Honor's Program, now currently known as the <i>Honors College</i>, I had learned that
        an education in College was not just about
        a degree or a job, but rather a journey where you find what it is in life that you enjoy and learn who you are
        as a person. Using this I realized that my Computer
        Science 1 class was very interesting to me and the world of Computing looked like a fun thing to
        explore.Eventually I joined
        clubs on campus for programming, I have gotten a job in the industry, and I have made some really great friends
        along the way. Along the way of learning about computer programming and incorporating it more into my life,
        I realized it was a journey that would take me on a never-ending adventure filled with learning and it makes me
        happy to know I go to work doing something I love.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today I have a job in the industry, goals of exploring the industry to find the thing that I like to do the
        most,
        and work on many projects to pass the time. I feel that there is an ocean in front of me of things I can learn
        and I'm very excited to feel
        that I'm understanding more and more of the field so that I can swim out and learn what interests me. I am happy
        what I'm doing and I have amazing friends, family,
        and a pretty girl whom I can share all of this with. In all honesty the ability to share your work with those
        you care about is the best part!
    </p>
    <p>
        In the future I want to be someone who loves going to work in the morning. I've seen first hand the misery of
        suffering
        through an awful job and I promised myself that I wouldn't do that. I found something I loved that will provide
        a good living
        for me and my family and I am very lucky to have done this. I could go on about where I want to be working in 5,
        10, 20 years but
        I honestly couldn't tell you succinctly. I hardly know myself! I do know that I will ride this wave until it
        takes me where I go and I'll end up where I end up.
